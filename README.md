# distr-create-version-action

This action creates a new version of a
[Distr](https://github.com/glasskube/distr) application.

Hook it into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically create a new version of your
application in Distr, every time you push a new release. It supports both Docker
and Helm applications.

## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml).

```yaml
- uses: glasskube/create-distr-version-action
  with:
    # Path to the Distr API, must end with /api/v1
    # Defaults to https://app.distr.sh/api/v1 â€“ if you are selfhosting set to, e.g. https://distr.example.com/api/v1
    api-base: ''

    # Distr Personal Access Token used to authenticate with the Distr API,
    # to create one, see https://distr.sh/docs/integrations/personal-access-token/
    # This is sensitive, so make sure to use a Github Repository secret to store and read it safely
    # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions
    # Required
    api-token: ''

    # ID of the Distr application that the version will be created in.
    # You can find and easily copy this ID in the list of applications in the Distr Web UI.
    application-id: ''

    # Name of the version that will be created
    # Required
    version-name: ''

    # Absolute path to the Docker Compose File inside the runner.
    # Example usage: ${{ github.workspace }}/docker-compose-prod.yml
    # Required for docker applications
    compose-file: ''

    # Helm Chart Type (allowed: "repository" or "oci")
    # Required for helm applications
    chart-type: ''

    # Helm Chart Name (required for helm applications if chart-type is "repository")
    chart-name: ''

    # Helm Chart Version (required for helm applications)
    chart-version: ''

    # Helm Chart URL (required for helm applications)
    chart-url: ''

    # Absolute path to the base values file for helm applications.
    # Example usage: ${{ github.workspace }}/base-values.yml
    # Optional
    base-values-file: ''

    # Absolute path to template file for both helm and docker applications.
    # Example usage: ${{ github.workspace }}/template
    # Optional
    template-file: ''
```

```

## Development

> [!NOTE]
>
> You'll need to have a reasonably modern version of
> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) handy (20.x or later should work!). If you are
> using a version manager like [`nodenv`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) or
> [`fnm`](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm), this template has a `.node-version`
> file at the root of the repository that can be used to automatically switch to
> the correct version when you `cd` into the repository. Additionally, this
> `.node-version` file is used by GitHub Actions in any `actions/setup-node`
> actions.

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build the JS bundle

```bash
npm run all
```

The bundle has to be commited to the repository, as it is used by the action.

#### (Optional) Test your action locally

The [`@github/local-action`](https://github.com/github/local-action) utility can
be used to test your action locally. It is a simple command-line tool that
"stubs" (or simulates) the GitHub Actions Toolkit. This way, you can run your
TypeScript action locally without having to commit and push your changes to a
repository.

The `local-action` utility can be run in the following ways:

- Visual Studio Code Debugger

  Make sure to review and, if needed, update
  [`.vscode/launch.json`](./.vscode/launch.json)

- Terminal/Command Prompt

  ```bash
  # npx local action <action-yaml-path> <entrypoint> <dotenv-file>
  npx local-action . src/main.ts .env
  ```

You can provide a `.env` file to the `local-action` CLI to set environment
variables used by the GitHub Actions Toolkit. For example, setting inputs and
event payload data used by your action. For more information, see the example
file, [`.env.example`](./.env.example), and the
[GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables).

## Validate the Action

You can now validate the action by referencing it in a workflow file. For
example, [`ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) demonstrates how to reference an
action in the same repository.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    id: checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Test Local Action
    id: test-action
    uses: ./
    with:
      # ...

  - name: Print Application Version ID
    id: output
    run: echo "${{ steps.test-action.outputs.created-version-id }}"
```

For example workflow runs, check out the
[Actions tab](https://github.com/glasskube/create-distr-version-action/actions)!

## Publishing a New Release

This project includes a helper script, [`script/release`](./script/release)
designed to streamline the process of tagging and pushing new releases for
GitHub Actions.

GitHub Actions allows users to select a specific version of the action to use,
based on release tags. This script simplifies this process by performing the
following steps:

1. **Retrieving the latest release tag:** The script starts by fetching the most
   recent SemVer release tag of the current branch, by looking at the local data
   available in your repository.
1. **Prompting for a new release tag:** The user is then prompted to enter a new
   release tag. To assist with this, the script displays the tag retrieved in
   the previous step, and validates the format of the inputted tag (vX.X.X). The
   user is also reminded to update the version field in package.json.
1. **Tagging the new release:** The script then tags a new release and syncs the
   separate major tag (e.g. v1, v2) with the new release tag (e.g. v1.0.0,
   v2.1.2). When the user is creating a new major release, the script
   auto-detects this and creates a `releases/v#` branch for the previous major
   version.
1. **Pushing changes to remote:** Finally, the script pushes the necessary
   commits, tags and branches to the remote repository. From here, you will need
   to create a new release in GitHub so users can easily reference the new tags
   in their workflows.
